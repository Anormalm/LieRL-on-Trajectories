# LieRL-on-Trajectories
LieRL is a research-driven, math-heavy project designed to infer the underlying Lie group structure of sequential transformations (e.g., robotic or agent trajectories). It combines tools from Lie theory, matrix calculus, and learning systems to analyze and model real-world movement data as flows on smooth manifolds.
